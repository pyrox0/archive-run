Archiving charity video game marathons since 2024

## Project Goal

**vgarchive.run** aims to be a comprehensive, searchable, in-depth archive of VODs for charity marathons. From links to the runs themselves, to donation data, and more.

We aim to be a one-stop-shop for references for marathons the world over. We welcome contributions from anyone, to ensure we have the most comprehensive dataset ever.
